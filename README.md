# FEM - News Homepage

To improve my skills and experiment with the Astro framework, I did this challenge through Frontend Mentor (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/news-homepage-H6SWTa1MFl).

I followed a guide in building the framework and the CSS, but put my own spin on this and rewrote it in SCSS.

So I built this challenge component based using Astro and wrote in HTML (Astro templating logic in it), SCSS and Javascript.
